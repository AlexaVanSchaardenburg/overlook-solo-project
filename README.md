## Overview of project and goals
### Summary
  During this project I created an application that where a user can book hotel rooms, filter rooms based off of type, view their past bookings and view how much they have spent of bookings total. The application also features a login page and all bookings persist allowing user to revist their past bookings.
  
### Goals
  - To become more familiar webpack
  - Use object and array prototype methods to perform data manipulation
  - Create a clear and accessible user interface
  - Make network requests to retrieve data
  - Implement a robust testing suite using TDD
  - Write DRY, reusable code that follows SRP (Single     Responsibility Principle)

## Overview of technologies used 
 - This project utilized webpack, GET and POST network   
   requests,  Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
 - GitHub and GitHub projects were used to organize and share     the project
 - The Chrome Dev Tools Lighthouse Tool and WAVE accessibility    tool were used to improve accessibility.

## Challenges, wins, and any other reflections
### Challenges
  The biggest challenge I overcame during this project was refactoring my code to create functions that followed SRP - this was challenging because I had a fetch call wrapped into some functions. Once I broke the the functions into smaller functions that follwed SRP it was easier to fetch only the data I needed during my POST and GET requests.
  
### Wins
  Utilizing the project board in GitHub to organize what tasks needed to be done was a huge win. This helped me prioritize what tasks to spend time on, what to come back to later, and what to put on the back burner. 

Time spent: 30 hrs
